    <p>
      You need to build this Card component from the specs 
      outlined in the project's README file. Add one or more 
      additional "Stories" (this function is a story) that 
      showcase your component, and use Storybook's addons, such as 
      the responsive viewport, or the AXE accessibility validator, 
      to ensure that your component code is bulletproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have scaffolded out two components to assist with your
      development - this one, which is intended to contain the contents 
      within the shaded 'card', as well as a 'CardContainer' component,
      that containts the composed component's structure.
    </p>
